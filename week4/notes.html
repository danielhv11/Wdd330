    <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
    <p>This chapter focuses a lot on forms. Form controls things like input fields, buttons and select menus. 
        It explains that forms used to work more on a backend environment but with the help of JavaScript they are
         more usable on a frontend environment as well. From doing my own research I learned that a form can be done
          through html only but because some forms might have different requirements or different ways of working that’s 
          why we use JavaScript. The one that I found easier to understand was form validation and I feel I got a very
           good concept of how it works.

    <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
    <p>This chapter focused on object-oriented programming. From what I understood from this chapter and a few videos is 
        that it is basically a style of programming in a way. It also mentions three main concepts:

        Encapsulation- This one is basically things being kept simple on the outside while the inner things are kept hidden. An example is used for an ‘ON BUTTON’.
        
        Polymorphism- This basically means that the same process can be used for different objects hence the poly in the word.
        
        Inheritance- Basically it means to add more things into something or more features.
