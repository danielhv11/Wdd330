    <h1>TESTING AND DEBUGGING</h1>
    <p>This chapter focuses a lot on the different warnings or errors that you can get while doing JavaScript. 
        One of the things that caught my attention the most was the ‘Strict mode’ thing you can add to your code. 
        In essence it gets more strict on detecting errors or using the authors words: ‘poor style’.
    </p>
    <p>From my own personal experience with coding not sure if it was really touched upon on this chapter 
        but I have noticed that adding extensions to Visual Studio Code like having your code look better with different 
        colors or things like that really helps you visualize things better and understand things better as well or at 
        least it helps me.
    </p>
    <p>Another thing to remember that is mentioned in this chapter is testing our code. I have gotten into the habit of doing code in parts or trying to achieve small goals 
        like if I am doing a website and I am trying to center a picture I try a solution then test it out. 
        That way I have noticed that if constantly test my code every 10 lines or something I can detect an error more 
        easily as if I just code an entire thing I won’t be able to detect where the error is. Visual Studio does help a lot 
        with helping you find those issues by highlighting things so that is definitely a great tool.
