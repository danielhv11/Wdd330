    <h1>Client-side form validation and using Fetch</h1>
    <p> For this readings we read from developer.mozilla about client-side validation. 
    Client-side form validation is basically when we verify that the information that was inputted or filled out
    was done in a correct way and matches what we were looking for. Some examples of form  validation can be a phone numberr format,
    credit card format, date or email address. We also learn that we can do it with either pure HTML5 or Javascript. For the HTML it showed
    some of the code that we would use which I was already pretty familiar with but it was good to see the JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
    For the Fetch chapter it started by explaining what it is and quoting the website: "The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses.
     It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network."
