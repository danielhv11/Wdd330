    <h1>The window object and HTML5 APIs</h1>
    <p> Chapter nine focuses a lot on the window object and the multiple things it can do or what it is useful for.
    From another website we learn that the window object represents an open window in a browser. 
    If a document contain frames (iframe tags), the browser creates one window object for the HTML document, and one additional window object for each frame.

    Chapter 14 talks about APIs and other attributes. It mentions the Data attribute which is "a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser"
    APIs on this chapter are explained as being able to store clients information in a similar way as cookies do.
